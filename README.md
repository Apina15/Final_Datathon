# Final_Datathon

The first piece of code that we ran was the data_cleanup.py to replace all the 'na' cells with values. 
The second was first_run.py to test for the best classifiers. 
The third is third_run.py to train the classifier and then saves the model. 
The last one is test_run.py which output the predictions from the saved model.
